== Introduction

RealGuardIO is a microservices-based security system management application that demonstrates modern architectural patterns including:

* Event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka and Eventuate TRAM
* Distributed transactions using the Saga pattern
* Policy-based authorization with Oso Cloud
* OAuth2/JWT authentication
* Transactional outbox pattern for reliable event publishing
* Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger
* Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern with Next.js

The application allows users to manage customers, employees, locations, and security systems with fine-grained, policy-based access control.
