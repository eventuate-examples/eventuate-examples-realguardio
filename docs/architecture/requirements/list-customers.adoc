Feature: List Customers
  As an authenticated user
  I want to view all customer organizations
  So that I can see which companies are registered in the system

  Scenario: Successfully retrieve customer list
    Given I am authenticated
    And the following customers exist:
      | customerId | name             |
      | 1          | Acme Corporation |
      | 2          | Beta Industries  |
      | 3          | Gamma LLC        |
    When I submit a request to list all customers
    Then I receive a 200 OK response
    And the response contains 3 customers
    And the customers are:
      | customerId | name             |
      | 1          | Acme Corporation |
      | 2          | Beta Industries  |
      | 3          | Gamma LLC        |

  Scenario: Retrieve empty customer list
    Given I am authenticated
    And no customers exist in the system
    When I submit a request to list all customers
    Then I receive a 200 OK response
    And the response contains an empty array

  Scenario: Attempt to list customers without authentication
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I submit a request to list all customers
    Then I receive a 401 Unauthorized response
