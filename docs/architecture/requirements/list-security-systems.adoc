Feature: List Security Systems
  As an authenticated user
  I want to view all security systems
  So that I can see which systems are registered in the system

  Scenario: Successfully retrieve security systems list
    Given I am authenticated
    And the following security systems exist:
      | systemId | name              | armed | locationId |
      | 1        | Building A Alarm  | true  | 101        |
      | 2        | Building B Alarm  | false | 102        |
      | 3        | Warehouse System  | true  | 103        |
    When I submit a request to list all security systems
    Then I receive a 200 OK response
    And the response contains 3 security systems
    And the security systems include their current armed status

  Scenario: Retrieve empty security systems list
    Given I am authenticated
    And no security systems exist in the system
    When I submit a request to list all security systems
    Then I receive a 200 OK response
    And the response contains an empty array

  Scenario: Attempt to list security systems without authentication
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I submit a request to list all security systems
    Then I receive a 401 Unauthorized response
