== Scenario: List Security Systems for User

=== Overview

This scenario describes how a user retrieves a filtered list of security systems they can access. The operation queries the Security System Service's CQRS view (location roles replica), which maintains replicated authorization data from the Customer Service. This demonstrates how the CQRS pattern enables efficient authorization-aware queries without cross-service calls.

participant "Security System\nService" as SecuritySystem
database "Location Roles\nReplica (CQRS View)" as Replica

User -> BFF: GET /api/securitysystems

BFF -> SecuritySystem: GET /securitysystems\n+ Bearer token
activate SecuritySystem

SecuritySystem -> SecuritySystem: Validate JWT token\n(not shown - JWKS endpoint)

SecuritySystem -> SecuritySystem: Extract userName\nfrom JWT claims

SecuritySystem -> Replica: Query security systems\nwith authorization filter\nJOIN customer_employee_location_role\nJOIN team_members + team_location_roles\nWHERE user_name = {userName}
activate Replica

note right of Replica
  The query joins:
  - security_system table
  - customer_employee_location_role (direct roles)
  - team_members + team_location_roles (team roles)

  Returns only security systems where
  the user has at least one role

SecuritySystem --> BFF: 200 OK\n[{id, name, armed, locationId, roleNames}]
deactivate SecuritySystem

BFF --> User: Display security systems\nwith available actions

=== Description

The sequence of events is:

. The User navigates to the security systems page in the BFF UI.

. The BFF sends a GET request to the Security System Service at `/securitysystems`, including the user's JWT bearer token for authentication.

. The Security System Service validates the JWT token (via IAM Service JWKS endpoint - not shown for brevity).

. The Security System Service extracts the `userName` (email address) from the JWT token claims.

. The Security System Service queries its local CQRS view (location roles replica) with a complex SQL join that:
.. Joins the `security_system` table with `customer_employee_location_role` to find systems where the user has direct location roles
.. UNIONs with a join to `team_members` and `team_location_roles` to find systems where the user has roles via team membership
.. Filters to only return security systems where the user has at least one role (SECURITY_SYSTEM_ARMER, SECURITY_SYSTEM_DISARMER, or SECURITY_SYSTEM_VIEWER)
.. Aggregates all applicable role names for each security system

. The CQRS view returns a filtered list of security systems with the user's roles at each location.

. The Security System Service returns a 200 OK response with the filtered security systems list, including the role names.

. The BFF displays the security systems to the user, showing only the systems they have access to and enabling actions (arm/disarm) based on their roles.

=== Why This Uses a CQRS View

Without the CQRS view, this query would require:

1. Query Security System Service for all security systems
2. For each security system, call Customer Service to check user's roles at that location
3. Filter the list based on roles
4. Multiple network round-trips (N+1 query problem)

With the CQRS view:

1. Single local database query with joins
2. No cross-service calls
3. Sub-millisecond response time
4. Works even if Customer Service is temporarily unavailable

=== Data Freshness

* The CQRS view is *eventually consistent* with Customer Service
* When an admin assigns a location role to an employee:
.. Customer Service publishes `CustomerEmployeeAssignedLocationRole` event
.. Event is consumed by Security System Service's replica module (typically within 100ms-2s)
.. New role immediately visible in subsequent queries
* The trade-off of eventual consistency is acceptable because role changes are infrequent administrative operations

=== Key Characteristics

* *CQRS Pattern*: Queries use replicated read model, commands use write model
* *Authorization-Aware Filtering*: Only returns security systems the user can access
* *Single Service Call*: BFF only calls Security System Service, no fan-out to Customer Service
* *Low Latency*: Local database query with indexes on `user_name` and `location_id`
* *Resilience*: Works independently of Customer Service availability
* *Role Aggregation*: Returns all roles (direct and team-based) in a single query
* *No Over-Fetching*: Authorization filtering happens in database, not application layer

=== Authorization Roles

The query respects the following roles at the location level:

* `SECURITY_SYSTEM_VIEWER` - Can view security system status
* `SECURITY_SYSTEM_ARMER` - Can arm security systems (implies viewer)
* `SECURITY_SYSTEM_DISARMER` - Can disarm security systems (implies viewer)

Users must have at least one of these roles at the security system's location to see it in the list.

=== Query Performance

* *Database Indexes*:
** `idx_customer_employee_location_role_user_name` - Fast lookup by user
** `idx_customer_employee_location_role_location_id` - Fast lookup by location
** Primary key indexes on `team_members` and `team_location_roles`

* *Query Complexity*: O(log n) due to index usage, where n = number of role assignments

* *Typical Response Time*: < 10ms for users with < 100 accessible security systems

=== Error Scenarios

* *Invalid Token*: If the JWT token is invalid, the service returns 401 Unauthorized.

* *No Accessible Systems*: If the user has no roles at any location, returns 200 OK with an empty array `[]`.

* *CQRS View Not Yet Populated*: If replica is empty (new deployment), returns empty list until events are processed.

* *Eventual Consistency Lag*: Newly assigned roles may not appear immediately (typically < 2s delay).

=== Relationship to Other Scenarios

This scenario demonstrates:

* *Why CQRS views are needed* - Efficient authorization-aware queries
* *Event-driven replication* - See create-customer-employee.adoc for how role assignments are published
* *Authorization enforcement* - Only shows systems the user can access
* *Read-side of CQRS* - Contrasted with arm-security-system.adoc (write-side)
