Implement the CQRS pattern:

* Security Service maintains a CQRS replica of CustomerEmployeeLocation roles:
  * Subscribes to CustomerEmployeeLocationCreated(userName, Long locationId, String roleName) published by the customer service
  * Updates using JDBC customer_employee_location_role table
  * Subscribes using Eventuate Tram

* Customer Service publishes CustomerEmployeeLocationCreated
  * Specifically CustomerService.assignLocationRole() publishes the event
  * Uses Eventuate Tram events: DomainEventPublisher

See https://eventuate.io/docs/manual/eventuate-tram/latest/getting-started-eventuate-tram-spring-boot.html section "Event publishing and consuming events"
