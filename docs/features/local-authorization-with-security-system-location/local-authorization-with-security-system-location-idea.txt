I want an optional profile OsoLocalSecuritySystemLocation that's used with UseOsoService.

When active, the security service does not publish Security System Location information to Oso.

Instead, it uses Oso Local authorization and queries its DB for SecuritySystem-Location information.

## Refined Understanding

**Profile:** `OsoLocalSecuritySystemLocation` (additive, used alongside `UseOsoService`)

**Behavior when active:**
1. The security-system-service does NOT publish `SecuritySystemAssignedToLocation` events
2. The `isAuthorized()` calls use Oso local data bindings to query the `security_system` table for the SecuritySystem-Location relationship
3. The `listLocal()` calls continue to work as before (already use local data bindings)

**Technical approach:**
- Add a fact definition to `local_authorization_config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  "has_relation(SecuritySystem:_, String:location, Location:_)":
    query: 'SELECT id, location_id FROM security_system WHERE location_id IS NOT NULL'
  ```
- Conditionally suppress `SecuritySystemAssignedToLocation` event publishing when profile is active
- Configure Oso to use local data bindings for the SecuritySystem-Location relationship in `isAuthorized()` calls

**Classification:** Educational/Example - demonstrating how to configure Oso local authorization for different use cases

**Scope:** Changes contained within security-system-service only
