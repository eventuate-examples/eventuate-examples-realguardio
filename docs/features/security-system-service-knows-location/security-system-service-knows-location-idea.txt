I want to make the following changes:

1. Locations are explicitly created in the Customer Service via a new REST endpoint:
   - `POST /customers/{customerId}/locations` with body `{ "name": "..." }`
   - Returns the created locationId
   - Locations can exist independently of SecuritySystems

2. The SecuritySystem-Location relationship is maintained by the Security System Service - not the Customer Service:
   - Remove `securitySystemId` field from Location entity in Customer Service
   - SecuritySystem stores `locationId` and `locationName`
   - One SecuritySystem per Location constraint enforced by Security System Service

3. SecuritySystem creation takes `locationId` as input (instead of creating a new Location):
   - Orchestration Service saga validates locationId exists
   - Saga fetches locationName during validation
   - SecuritySystem created with locationId + locationName reference
