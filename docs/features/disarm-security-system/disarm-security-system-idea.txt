I want to add a PUT /securitysystems/{securitySystemID} endpoint to the Security Service.

This will be used to arm/disarm the SecuritySystem

The endpoint requires the user to have the role of REALGUARDIO_CUSTOMER_EMPLOYEE or REALGUARDIO_ADMIN

if the user has a role of REALGUARDIO_CUSTOMER_EMPLOYEE then the SecuritySystemService must retrieve the user's roles for the SecuritySystem's location (it will have a locationID property) from the CustomerService and verify that the roles allow the requested operation

An GET endpoint must be added to the CustomerService

If the operation is authorized then the state of the SecuritySystem is changed.
