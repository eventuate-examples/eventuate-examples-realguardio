I want the security-system-service to implement a POST /securitysystems that creates a security system

The request body should contain the following:

* customerID - the ID of the customer in the CustomerService
* locationName - the name of the location in the CustomerService

The creation will be implemented using an Eventuate Tram Saga consisting of the following steps:

1. Creates a SecuritySystem in a PENDING state
2. Invokes the Customer Service to validate the customerID, and create/update the location with the security SystemID - fails if the location exists and has a securitySystme already
3. Invokes the SecuritySystemService to update the SecuritySystem with the locationID and changes it state to DISARMED

Here's the Eventuate docs:
