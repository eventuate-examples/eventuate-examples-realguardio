Speed up GitHub Actions workflow by implementing Docker Layer Caching for the 6 custom services.

SOLUTION:
- Use Docker buildx bake with GitHub Actions Cache (type=gha)
- Environment-controlled via mise.toml (auto-enabled in CI)
- Two-phase build: buildx bake (with caching) + docker compose up --no-build
- Layered cache strategy: dependencies cached separately from source code
- Per-branch caching with 7-day expiration
- Parallel builds of all 6 services

BENEFITS:
- Significantly faster CI builds (especially for dependency-only or no changes)
- Zero impact on local development workflow
- Automatic in GitHub Actions (GITHUB_ACTIONS=true)
- Optional for local testing (USE_DOCKER_CACHE=true)

FILES TO MODIFY:
1. mise.toml - Add conditional caching logic to compose tasks
2. .github/workflows/test.yml - Add buildx setup step

IMPLEMENTATION: See use-docker-layer-caching-discussion.md for full specification
