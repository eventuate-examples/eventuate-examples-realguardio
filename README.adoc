This project is part of http://eventuate.io[Eventuate], which is a microservices collaboration platform.

= RealGuardIO - a fictional commercial real estate security system platform.

This project is a fictional commercial real estate security system platform. 
It's the sample application for a series of articles about authentication and authorization in microservices:

1. https://microservices.io/post/architecture/2025/04/25/microservices-authn-authz-part-1-introduction.html[Overview of authentication and authorization in a microservice architecture]
2. https://microservices.io/post/architecture/2025/05/28/microservices-authn-authz-part-2-authentication.html[Implementing authentication]
3. Implementing simple authorization
4. Developing complex authorization
5. Implementing complex authorization using Oso Cloud - part 1
6. Implementing complex authorization using Oso Cloud - part 2

== Application architecture

image::https://microservices.io/i/microservices-auth/part-2/Security-Architecture.png[]

The key elements of the RealGuardIO architecture are as follows:

* React-based UI - runs in the browser and implements the RealGuardIO UI.
* `BFF`  - the NextJS/Typescript-based Backend for front-end, which plays the role of an OAuth 2.0 client. It manages the user's session, forwards requests from the React UI to the backend services and implements security using the `next-auth` library.
* `IAM service` - handles authentication including the login page and issues access tokens and ID tokens to BFF.
* `Security System Service` - manages `SecuritySystems`

In addition, there's https://www.jaegertracing.io/[`jaeger`] for distributed tracing.

== Code tours

Coming soon.

== Running the application

The application uses Docker Compose to run the services.

To run the application, you simply need to install the following prerequisites: Docker.

You can run the application using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
docker compose up -d --build
----

You can stop the application using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
docker compose down
----

== Using the application

You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

The credentials are `user1/password`.

== Jaeger distributed tracing

Jaeger is used for distributed tracing in this application. 
It allows you to trace requests as they flow through services.

You can access the https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger UI] at http://localhost:16686.

Here are the http://localhost:16686/search?service=realguardio-bff&&tags=%7B%22span.kind%22%3A%22client%22%7D[outbound requests from the BFF].

== Developing the application

The application is written in Java, Typescript and React.
To do development, you simply need to install and setup the following prerequisite: https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html[Mise].
Mise will then install Java 17 and Node.js v22.x for you.
